# hello-world
The First Github respository for learning about Github

I am making a first edit to my first repository!!
Excited about using gitHub for my projects....
So far, I am finding it very useful, interesting and easy to use.

Hello Sugar Labs !! I am Aneesh Sharma and I have made my edit for the Google Code-In task of Git Introduction from Sugar Labs. I am excited about joining the open source community through the tasks in the Google Code-In contest. I would love to contribute my codes and works to the World for Free in the open source way!!

Google Code-In is doing a great work in making more people reach the open source community through this contest.
